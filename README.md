Parrano is a .NET wrapper for the [PSlib](http://pslib.sourceforge.net) C API. [PSlib](http://pslib.sourceforge.net) is a popular C library for generating multi page PostScript documents. There are functions for drawing lines, arcs, rectangles, curves, etc. [PSlib](http://pslib.sourceforge.net) also provides very sophisticated functions for text output including hyphenation and kerning, as well as the ability to define custom fonts and encodings.

The [PSlib](http://pslib.sourceforge.net) version that this wrapper is based on is v0.4.0. Please check the [PSlib home page](http://pslib.sourceforge.net) to obtain the latest version. 

Parrano also includes a simple PostScript parser.
